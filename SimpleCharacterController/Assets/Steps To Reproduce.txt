This pdf teaches you how to recreate this project step by step

Process:

	Create a new cube and make its size (20, 0.25, 20) and call it ground.
	Delete the camera that comes with the scene. The name is "MainCamera"
	Place some random cubes around the scene.
	Create a new capsule and call it player, then position it at (0, 1, 0)
	Create a camera and parent it to the player object, then make its position (0, 0.8, 0)
	Now make a prefabs folder and drag the player object inside it.
	
	Now create a new folder inside the assets folder and call it "Scripts" and inside of it, 
	create two new scripts: "CharacterMotor" and "CameraHandler"
	
	Add the "CharacterMotor" script to the Player object and the "CameraHandler" script to the camera under it.
	
	Follow the youtube tutorial that comes along with this project to know how to write these two scripts.
	
	Enjoy.
