This pdf teaches you how to recreate this project step by step

Process:

	Create a new cube and make its size (20, 0.25, 20) and call it ground.
	Delete the camera that comes with the scene. The name is "MainCamera"
	Place some random cubes around the scene.
	Create a new capsule and call it player, then position it at (0, 1, 0)
	Delete the capsule collider from it and add a Character Controller component.
	Create a camera and parent it to the player object, then make its position (0, 0.8, 0)
	Now make a prefabs folder and drag the player object inside it.
	
	Follow the youtube tutorial that comes along with this project to know how to write the scripts included.
	
	Enjoy.
